## âš¡ Overview

Zoxxer is a **comprehensive personal security and system monitoring tool**. Its purpose is to help users detect suspicious files, monitor network activity, encrypt sensitive logs, and manage system security settings in a safe, controlled manner.  

This is **not malware** â€” it is a security utility. Always review detected files before deleting, and only run on systems you have permission to manage.
